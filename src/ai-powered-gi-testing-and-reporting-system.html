                                                A digital patient journey provides patients with step-by-step instructions, timely reminders, and easy access to consent forms and symptom collection tools. This reduces the number of invalid tests and makes the testing process more convenient and efficient for patients.

                                                Manual report generation is time-consuming and increases the workload on clinical staff, while a fragmented patient journey can lead to confusion, increased invalid tests, and a poor patient experience. Both issues can hinder the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery.
