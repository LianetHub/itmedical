                                    </p>

                                        The customer required us to build a custom patient management system (PMS) for care organizations consisting of several subsystems. The PMS system is needed to manage and analyze medication intake, collect statistics on treatment dynamics per patient, and use the accumulated information to recommend suitable treatments. This would facilitate care providers' decision-making and ensure tailored patient care. Generic PMS systems fall short in all of the following:
                                    </p>

                                            <span>Comprehensive Medication Management:</span>
                                            Generic PMS systems often fail to provide detailed medication management tailored to individual patient needs. Care homes require a system that can track, analyze, and manage medication intake effectively, ensuring patients receive the correct medication at the right times, without lapsing on med refills.

                                            A generic PMS system might not offer the depth of analysis needed to understand patient progress and treatment efficacy, which is vital for mental health rehabilitative services.

                                            <span>Decision Support for Health Care Providers:</span>
                                            Care providers need a system that helps them make informed decisions based on real-time data and historical treatment outcomes. A generic PMS system often lacks the integrated decision-support tools necessary for personalized patient care.

                                            Managing tasks within care homes involves numerous repetitive and critical activities. A custom PMS solution should support unlimited automatic tasks with the flexibility to assign them appropriately, reducing administrative burden and ensuring tasks are completed efficiently and on time.

                                            The ability to integrate with other parts of the care ecosystem, such as external health systems and APIs, is a necessity for proper care. This ensures seamless data flow and comprehensive care management, which is often lacking in generic PMS solutions.

Auto-tasks are preconfigured in the admin panel and activated when triggered inside or by an external system via the API. Tasks can be allocated to multiple employees, with one primary employee in charge, ensuring accountability and efficiency.

                                            The PMS allows for detailed management and analysis of medication intake, helping to track and adjust treatments as needed. This ensures that each patientâ€™s medication plan is followed accurately, improving treatment outcomes. The system can track side effects, manage refill schedules, improve medication adherence, and identify reasons why a patient might not be taking their medication (e.g., affordability issues, uncomfortable side effects, lack of transportation, insurance coverage gaps, or inability to self-administer medication). This helps reduce polypharmacy and improve overall patient health.

                                            The system collects and analyzes data on treatment dynamics per patient, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of different treatments. This data-driven approach supports care providers in making informed decisions tailored to each patientâ€™s needs.

                                            The system helps physicians from all specialties coordinate care. A significant issue in patient care is the lack of communication between various specialists, which can lead to polypharmacy and adverse health outcomes. For example, a pulmonologist might prescribe a beta-blocker for asthma, while a cardiologist might prescribe a counteracting drug, leading to ineffective treatment. Our PMS addresses this by ensuring that all care providers have access to a patient's comprehensive medication and treatment history, facilitating better coordination and outcomes.
