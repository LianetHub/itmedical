We also limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.

We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation with respect to our relationship with you.

                                        Request access to the personal data we hold about you, free of charge in most cases (known as a “data subject access request”). Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you where it is incorrect, out of date or incomplete. Request deletion of your personal data in certain circumstances. You may exercise this right where there is no good reason for us to continue to process your personal data, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Object to processing of your personal data, for example where we are relying on a legitimate interest but you feel the processing impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms or where we are relying on consent and you withdraw your consent. You may also object where we are using your personal data for direct marketing. Request restriction of processing of your personal data in specific circumstances. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data. Request the transfer of your personal data (where automated) to you or to a third party. We will provide you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.

This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
