                                        The customer had a working prototype software platform that allowed them to collect disease reports and research from relevant sources and store them. However, it did not meet all their requirements, including knowledge base management and report generation. The client wanted a solution that would streamline patient case analysis and facilitate treatment selection through access to relevant research studies.

                                            The prototype lacked an efficient way to manage and organize the vast amount of collected research and disease reports. A comprehensive knowledge base was needed to make this information easily accessible and usable by medical experts.

                                            The existing platform did not support the automatic generation of detailed reports, facilitating informed treatment decisions. This functionality saves time and ensures consistency in the information provided to oncologists.

                                            The platform needed to facilitate the analysis of patient cases by integrating relevant research studies directly into the decision-making process. This would help doctors select the most appropriate treatments based on the latest evidence.

                                            To be effective, the new solution had to integrate seamlessly with existing Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS), as well as with laboratory and insurance service providers. This integration ensures that all relevant patient data and research information are available in one place.

                                            Medical experts, curators, doctors, and nurses required different levels of access. The platform needed a robust system to manage these varying levels of access and ensure that sensitive information was only available to authorized personnel.
