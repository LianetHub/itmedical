                                        Technology is essential to the healthcare industry, but even though advancements have expanded diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, there remains substantial room for improvement in data management.

                                        Access to such a wealth of information should be an advantage, but the sheer volume of available content often proves too time-consuming for providers to sift through.

                                        Approximately 97% go unreviewed and unutilized, preventing researchers from analyzing valuable clinical findings and physicians from providing high-quality care <sup>(3)</sup>. As data continues pouring into EMR systems, the problem grows.

                                        The user interfaces of many EMR systems are complicated…so complicated that they can hinder doctors' abilities to perform basic tasks, such as prescribing the correct dosage of medication <sup>(4)</sup>. Nurses, doctors, physician assistants, and other medical professionals are well-educated, but their curricula focus on body systems and disease, not navigating software programs.
                                    </strong>
                                    <p>
                                        Despite many improvements to EMR systems over the decades, practitioners still click through seemingly endless data collection screens and search for elusive yet critical data. When this happens during a patient encounter, both parties can feel frustrated, leading to decreased patient satisfaction and, possibly, poor treatment compliance.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Frustration can also lead to errors like a dosage miscalculation, incorrect follow-up instructions, or worse. For instance, a Vermont attorney died from an aneurysm in 2012–just two months after her doctor recommended a (potentially life-saving) brain scan. The woman never had the scan because the physician’s order was “lost in the system” <sup>(5)</sup>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another problem relevant to managing healthcare data is that the various EMR systems on the market don’t communicate well with one another. Whether a hospitalized patient is being transferred for specialized care or a family is moving to a new state, their medical history should be readily available to their healthcare team.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Patient records contain vital information such as detailed demographics, diagnoses, treatment plans, and prescription histories, so data isolation poses a serious problem <sup>(6)</sup>.

                                    <p>To move toward the hospital of the future, a “<b>reinvention</b>” needs to take place. This must include a digital backbone that will integrate care in the facility, community, and home. A new shape is taking form, starting from the inside (<b>smart hospital</b>) to the outside (<b>virtual wards</b>) and encompassing what the patient expects (<b>precision medicine</b>).</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li aria-level="2"><b>Smart Hospital</b> <b>–</b> The current smart hospital concept supports automation in administrative workflows to boost productivity, reduce errors, and tackle workforce shortages. With advancements in engineering and AI, automation is also emerging in core medical tasks, such as diagnostic imaging, patient monitoring, fine surgical procedures, nursing, prevention and rehabilitation, and data management and analytics.&nbsp; A smart hospital is primarily a hospital without borders, extending to any place of interest outside the health system, encompassing any place where the patient resides, such as home and workplace, recreational areas, or any point of care <sup><a href="#reference12">(12)</a></sup>.</li>
                                        <li aria-level="2"><b>Virtual Wards – </b>The concept of virtual wards has existed for some time <sup><a href="#reference13">(13)</a></sup>.&nbsp; The COVID-19 pandemic expanded the use of virtual wards, which had an apparent good effect on managing selected patients with COVID-19 using a pulse oximeter and monitoring them through secondary care.&nbsp; Large-scale investment is being made to extend the “point of care” where the patients themselves are, thanks to remote care and telehealth services. This means that patients can now be monitored and receive healthcare recommendations from the comfort of their homes.&nbsp; Such approaches have already been piloted in countries like the UK, the US, Singapore, and Australia <sup><a href="#reference14">(14)</a></sup><sup><a href="#reference15">(15)</a></sup>.&nbsp; As they become more common in the future, hospitals must be adequately equipped and designed to support such a modality of care delivery.</li>

                                    <p>Most consumer hassles are due to issues other than providing clinical care—namely, living a healthy lifestyle, accessing and navigating the system, and paying for care. Innovating on these dimensions requires hospitals to reframe their propositions and brands, providing a <b><i>value-based partnership</i></b>.</p>
                                    <h3><b>The</b> <b>value-based</b> <b>partnership</b> is occurring across two dimensions:</h3>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li aria-level="2"><b>Connecting the member and patient experience</b>:<br>
                                            Providers are launching joint ventures with payers to deliver a VIP experience.&nbsp; This means rapid access to a clinician and a seamless transition from the intake process to discharge. Providence St. Joseph Health partnered with Microsoft to offer a health bot and expanded urgent care centers where they offer “Express Care.”&nbsp; Patients can be seen, treated, and discharged at express care in under 2 hours.&nbsp; Services are expanded beyond low acuity care to include health and wellness, nutrition counseling, sleep and stress management, fitness programs, and more. The physical space feels more like a hotel than a hospital waiting room <sup><a href="#reference18">(18)</a></sup>.</li>
                                        <li aria-level="2"><strong>Optimize the performance of individual parts.<br>
                                            </strong>The exponential rise in healthcare spending and staffing shortages are forcing hospitals to reassess their economics and do “more for less.” This means enhancing clinical productivity and linking fragmented services, thus reducing variability and waste. A notable example is Intermountain Healthcare, which announced last year that it is reorganizing its geographical structure around two areas—community care and specialty care <sup><a href="#reference19">(19)</a></sup>. The former will focus on preventative services, like health screenings and primary care. The specialist group aims to deliver the proper care at the right time through specialist and hospital inpatient settings.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <h3>Fixed asset reallocation</h3>
                                    <p>Systems face declining inpatient utilization and are left with excessive and expensive bed capacity.&nbsp; The current response is to close floors, resulting in gaps in care and staffing issues.</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li aria-level="1">Healthcare systems must adapt current models and redesign with the future in mind.&nbsp; This means: 1. repurpose spaces that enable care delivery beyond the physical walls, 2. streamline processes around partners, vendors, and solutions across the system, and 3. create flexible areas that can be repurposed over decades.</li>
                                        <li aria-level="1">New York City’s Mount Sinai took this approach. Instead of shuttering its legacy 1,139-bed downtown hospital, the system is transforming a traditional inpatient facility into an integrated ambulatory hub, with a full-service emergency department, 70 short-stay beds, and a half million square feet of multidisciplinary ambulatory services, including physician offices, urgent care centers, retail clinics, and pharmacies <sup><a href="#reference20">(20)</a></sup>.</li>

Payers facing budgetary pressures (and, in some cases, financial losses); and <b>3. Technological Innovations</b> like Sunny (robotics) and AI (automation).</p>
