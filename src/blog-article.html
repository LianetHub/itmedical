                                        Access to such a wealth of information should be an advantage, but the sheer volume of available content often proves too time-consuming for providers to sift through.

                                        Approximately 97% go unreviewed and unutilized, preventing researchers from analyzing valuable clinical findings and physicians from providing high-quality care <sup>(3)</sup>. As data continues pouring into EMR systems, the problem grows.

                                        The user interfaces of many EMR systems are complicated…so complicated that they can hinder doctors' abilities to perform basic tasks, such as prescribing the correct dosage of medication <sup>(4)</sup>. Nurses, doctors, physician assistants, and other medical professionals are well-educated, but their curricula focus on body systems and disease, not navigating software programs.
                                    </strong>
                                    <p>
                                        Despite many improvements to EMR systems over the decades, practitioners still click through seemingly endless data collection screens and search for elusive yet critical data. When this happens during a patient encounter, both parties can feel frustrated, leading to decreased patient satisfaction and, possibly, poor treatment compliance.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Frustration can also lead to errors like a dosage miscalculation, incorrect follow-up instructions, or worse. For instance, a Vermont attorney died from an aneurysm in 2012–just two months after her doctor recommended a (potentially life-saving) brain scan. The woman never had the scan because the physician’s order was “lost in the system” <sup>(5)</sup>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another problem relevant to managing healthcare data is that the various EMR systems on the market don’t communicate well with one another. Whether a hospitalized patient is being transferred for specialized care or a family is moving to a new state, their medical history should be readily available to their healthcare team.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Patient records contain vital information such as detailed demographics, diagnoses, treatment plans, and prescription histories, so data isolation poses a serious problem <sup>(6)</sup>.
