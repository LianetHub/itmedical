                                        The idea behind the platform was to connect patients in remote locations with the research center’s doctors and medical professionals through a mobile application. This app aimed to improve access to high-quality healthcare in remote areas by including video, audio, and text chat communication methods, as well as video and photo exchange between doctors and patients. The solutions necessitated compliance with HIPAA regulations due to the sensitivity of medical data. A solution that has been expatiated upon would contain all of the following:
